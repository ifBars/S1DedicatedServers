# S1DedicatedServers

Run a headless, authoritative server for Schedule I using the Dedicated Server Mod. The server replicates the original host flow (network, loopback client, save/load, quests, time, sleep) and is designed for long-running worlds.

## This mod is in alpha

This release is an early alpha (beta at best). You should expect bugs, incomplete features, and occasional instability. I'm releasing it in a working but not fully stable state specifically to gather community feedback and iterate quickly.
